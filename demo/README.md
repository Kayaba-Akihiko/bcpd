NOTE 1:
Files whose names begin with demoPlusPlus are BCPD++ examples.

NOTE 2:
To run the demo regarding the "shape transfer" with Windows, it is essential to
prepare a UNIX-like environment. Please use MINGW and MSYS systems, for example.

NOTE 3:
For Windows, demoPlusPlusLucy.m fails because of memory allocation error,
which originates from the MINGW's 32-bit compilation.
