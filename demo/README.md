# Demo

## Point set registration
MATLAB scripts under this directory will demonstrate
various examples.

- Function registration (DET) examples:
  - Color/gray images, audio signals, human shapes.
- 3D Reconstruction (BCPD) examples:
  - Chef.
- Nonrigid (GBCPD/GBCPD++) examples:
  - Human shapes, human faces.
- Nonrigid (BCPD) examples:
  - Fish, Monkey, Bunny, Face, Armadillo, Dragon.
- Nonrigid (BCPD++) examples:
  - Armadillo, Dragon, Asian Dragon, Lucy.
- Rigid (BCPD) examples:
  - Chef, Parasaurolophus, T-rex, Apartment, Stairs.

## Shape transfer
Bash scripts in `shapeTransfer` will demonstrate
several examples without MATLAB.  Please check
output files named `transferV[1/2]_y.interpolated.obj`
after executing a script.

## Notes
- It is possible to use BCPD without MATLAB by using
  a command-line interface. MATLAB is used only for
  visualizing registration results.
- If your OS is Windows, please install the MinGW/MSYS
  system to run Bash scripts.
- For Windows, demoPlusPlusLucy.m fails because of a
  memory allocation error originating from the
  MinGW's 32-bit compilation.
