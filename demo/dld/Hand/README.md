# Instructions 

The demo program runs in the MATLAB command prompt with the following scripts:

- runTrainingHand      (+Enter)
- runDemoHandDLD       (+Enter)
- runDemoHandDLDxBCPD  (+Enter)

1. The 1st script trains a hand shape model in a leave-one-out manner.
2. The 2nd script executes DLD to fit the shape model to each hand shape.
3. The 3rd script does the same as the 2nd script, and executes BCPD to fine-tune the fitting.
